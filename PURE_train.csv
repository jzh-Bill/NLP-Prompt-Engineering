4819,"The purpose of this deliverable D8, entitled “Functional Specification and Architecture”, is twofold: • summarizing the progress in the BEYOND project, • clarifying the approach in the process of going from the first to the second milestone.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4820,"The purpose and approach of D8 has been agreed upon during the team meeting in Delft (Nl), November 2000. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4821,"The following arguments contributed to the definition of D8, as it is currently presented.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4822,"D8, “Functional Specification and Architecture”, can to some extent be considered as a second iteration on D2 ""Requirements and Usability Methodology"". ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4823,The rationale behind this conclusion is as follows. ,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4824,"After describing ""key concepts"" in deliverable D1, the BEYOND partners have contributed to D2, in which the requirements have been detailed and the usability methodology has been described. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4825,Most of the BEYOND partners planned to have a first prototype at the time of the first milestone (after one year of research in the consortium). ,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4826,"This is in particular the case for the partners that are directly active in one of the application domains (Public domain, Home domain, Vetronics domain, Avionics domain). ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4827,"Consequently, the requirements stated in D2 are considered as a kind of checklist for the first prototype. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4828,"Based on the lessons learnt from the first prototype, ideas for the second prototype have been collected. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4829,"So we can consider the presented D8 as a description of the functional specifications for the second prototype to be delivered at milestone two (at the end of the BEYOND project, after two years of research in the consortium). ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4830,It seems acceptable that the relation D2-milestone 1/prototype 1 is the same as D8-milestone 2/prototype 2.,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4831,"Also it is in accordance with Software Engineering terminology that D8 speaks about Functional Specifications, which are usually closer to the design/architecture than the Requirements in D2, which were most of the time high-level requirements, not very detailed.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4832,"Besides this, it turns out that most of the BEYOND partners that are directly active in one of the application domains (Public domain, Home domain, Vetronics domain, Avionics domain) have a prototype/demonstrator that evolves from a version at milestone one to a final version (at least within the BEYOND project context) at milestone two. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4833,This as opposed to the realization of new prototypes during the second half of the project period.,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4834,As a result it was decided that a domain-oriented approach provides a comprehensive structure for this deliverable.,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4835,"It supports the placement of the individual projects in their context, and allows key aspects of the involved workpackages (multimodality, adaptivity, simulation and usability) to be emphasized. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4836,"It is indeed important that all the key aspects of the workpackages (WP1: multimodality, WP2: adaptivity, WP3: simulation and WP4: usability) are present, because this document is a common deliverable for all consortium partners. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4837,"However, we opted to let the workpackages take part through projects in application domains in order to obtain a coherent and comprehensive report. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4838,As several partners are active within several workpackages this turned out to be a workable solution.,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4839,"The contributions that are found in the following chapters are: Public domain: Accesspoints; public information kiosks Home domain: UI for future in-home electronic systems (Home Experience, Multimodal Jukebox) UI editor for consumer domain",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4840,"The order in which the domains and the individual projects within the domains are organized is rather deliberate: from the public domain with UIs for everyone in everyday circumstances, over the other application domains to the avionics domain, with UIs for very select users in a professional environment.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4841,"It should be emphasized (and it should be obvious after reading this deliverable) that the key aspects multimodality, adaptivity, simulation and usability are independent variables. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4842,"They are different dimensions along which the UIs are investigated, but they have nothing to do with the order in which the projects are listed. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4843,The level to which these aspects have been addressed in the projects differs considerably. ,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4844,"Therefore, for each of the projects listed, there will be separate sections devoted to the key aspects in order to (1) show the integrative level as an advantage of cooperation in the consortium and (2) to focuss on particular efforts concerning multimodality, adaptivity, simulation and usability. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4845,"Also, there are sections on architectural issues.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4846,"It has to be explicitly stated that due to uncertainties in the German funding situation, the consortium lacked the experienced partners for a separate usability workpackage. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4847,"Therefore, the other partners had to find a way to overcome this problem.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4848,"One consequence is that most of the contributing partners devoted resources to usability engineering activities, as reported in this deliverable.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4849,"The above mentioned relation between deliverables D1 (key concepts), D2 (requirements) and D8 (functional specifications) is applicable for all the listed projects. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4850,"D1, D2 and D8 are all common deliverables. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4851,"Besides this, there are relations with other deliverables that are the result of particular workpackages. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4852,"For instance, D3 “Common Adaptivity Reference Framework” from WP2 comes into play in the adaptivity and/or architectural sections of this document. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4853,"This illustrates that the migration from the first to the second prototype takes into account adaptivity issues, possibly inspired by the cooperation in the context of the adaptivity framework. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4854,Similar relations can be found with regard to multimodality and simulation. ,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4855,"It is likely that the relationship also extends to future deliverables, intended to provide even more detail when we progress towards milestone 2.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4856,The next chapters list the individual projects and are integrated by the information provided by the project responsibles. ,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4857,"Finally, project-wide conclusions concerning the evolution from the first to the second milestone are formulated.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req

4859,"In particular, functional requirements and possibly their translation into architectural issues have been listed.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4860,This has been illustrated through the individual projects within the targeted application domains. I,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4861,"n the description the key aspects multimodality, adaptivity, simulation and usability have been considered as independent variables, allowing to show the progress for all workpackages in the project.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4862,"While all of the projects evolve in one way or another from the first to the second prototype, there are big differences in that evolution. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4863,"Between the alternatives we find extremes such as performing a second iteration with different points of attention, or looking for alternative solutions for the same research questions as asked earlier in the project.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4864,"In correspondence with the allocation of resources in individual workpackages, multimodality and/or adaptivity and/or simulation and/or usability are stressed differently in the migration to the second prototype. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4865,It catches the eye that several projects envisage architectural changes to accomodate the desired extensions.,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4866,Aspects of multimodality and simulation have only been focussed upon in this document as far as this contributes to the overall functional specifications of the presented projects. ,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4867,Details of these aspects will appear in deliverables per workpackage.,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4868,"With regard to adaptivity, the diversity in feasibility and approach stated in deliverables D2 (requirements) and D3 (adaptivity reference framework) are confirmed in the functional specifications.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4869,"It has been mentioned already that in the “emergency scenario” (no subsidy for German partners and no replacement), most partners had to tackle the usability issues by themselves. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4870,"Wherever appropriate, individual prototypes have been subject to usability studies. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4871,This was not always possible: the limited nature of the first prototype and time constraints (BEYOND is a short term project) are mentioned amongst other restrictions. ,beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4872,"However, even if usability studies are carried out it is remarked that more longitudinal studies are required in this context, e.g. with regard to adaptivity issues. Questionnaires and expert reviews have been applied with success within different projects and domains.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4873,"Depending on the project, architectural issues translate functional specifications to (most of the time high-level) system design, or list additional specifications. ",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4874,"Projects involving adaptivity usually refer to D3, “adaptivity reference framework”, in their section about architecture.",beyond.pdf,Not_Req
4875,The presented projects also follow general tendencies with regard to software development. ,beyond.pdf,Not_Req

7113,"This section does not state specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to understand by giving them context. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7114,"That context and the overall intent of the Clarus program are described in detail in the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref. 12), from which much of the description in this section was derived. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7115,Descriptions of specific terms and acronyms used in this section may be found in Appendix A.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7116,The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a “network of networks” — much like the Internet — for surface transportation environmental data. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7117,"While the Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition) data collection networks. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7118,Each of the weather networks will function autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without direction or dependence on Clarus.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7119,Each participating weather network’s connection to Clarus will add two new possible modes of functionality. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7120,"First, the participant will be able to share collected environmental data with Clarus. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7121,"Second, participants will be able to receive environmental data collected by Clarus. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7122,"The primary recipients of this data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able to receive data if they so chose. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7123,"This concept of autonomous data sharing is comparable to the World Wide Web layer of the Internet, where organizations can publish information on web pages, or browse and download information published by other organizations on the web. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7124,"Ownership of the data is retained by the organization that provided the data to Clarus, and the provider organization can restrict the dissemination of the data through data sharing agreements with the Clarus program.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7125,"The Clarus system will add a third mode of functionality, which might be called “meta-librarian.” ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7126,"The Clarus system will collect, organize, and qualify the environmental data to be published by the system. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7127,"The data will be collected from the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be added. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7128,"When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and other participant/consumers in Clarus. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7129,Figure 1 shows the general process as data progresses from collection through publication to service providers.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7130,"Figure 1 – Clarus Data Acquisition, Processing, and Publication.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7131,"The principal interfaces that will be critical to Clarus are the interface between Clarus and the participating collectors, and the interface between Clarus and the participating service providers. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7132,"While the service provider interface is completely within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7133,"While the participants want to access the network through “a one-stop internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related observations” (Ref. 12), there is no requirement that the system be a single centralized system. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7134,Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a “one-stop” portal.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7135,The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7136,"While some data retention is likely to be necessary to support the quality control function and the publication function, there is a clear recognition that as the data age, they lose value to all but climatological investigators and other researchers. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7137,This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of environmental data in Clarus. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7138,"Considering the technical scope of such an effort, archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is operational and proven.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7139,"The Clarus system will collect data from contributing members, organize and qualify the data, and then publish the data for use by service providers and other members of the network. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7140,These basic processes are shown in Figure 2 in terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7141,"The ellipses represent specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the interactions between them. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req

7143,Figure 2 – Basic Clarus System Objects and Functions.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7144,"The volume of data involved in this process has the potential to become very large, which leads to a significant challenge in developing a system that can effectively gather, organize, and disseminate the data. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7145,The Clarus system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7146,Determining data types will be a significant challenge. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7147,Proper understanding of the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest efficiency.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7148,"While there are many types of environmental data that could be collected, the Clarus emphasis on surface weather and transportation puts the focus on those weather elements that have a direct bearing on surface transportation systems. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7149,These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP standard for Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref. 8) and summarized in Table 1.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7150,Table 1 – Potential Clarus Environmental Data Elements.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7151,"There are basic temporal limits for the data collection, quality control, processing, and publication of the environmental data. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7152,There is also a period for which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7153,The design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the technical limitations of the system architecture. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7154,These data time horizons are illustrated in Figure 3.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7155,Figure 3 – Time Horizons for Weather Data.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7156,The average elapsed time for the Autonomous Layer varies as a result of configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within the operation of the system to collect the data. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7157,The Clarus component includes the time required to communicate data from the Autonomous Layer to the Clarus system import process as well as the time required to process the input data into storage structures. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7158,"Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the required human- and machine-based product generation. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7159,The average data age grows as a result of the aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to the Service Provider Customers. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7160,The Clarus system design must address how best to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7161,"For the purposes of defining the boundaries of these time horizons, the following definitions apply:",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7162,Average Elapsed Time is the estimated time for the process within a given layer or layer sub-division to take place. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7163,The age of observed and recorded values can vary widely within these bands.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7164,Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as it is transferred from the ESS to the end user.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7165,Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7166,"Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with the system components.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7167,"The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly accessing the data published by the Clarus system.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req

7173,Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7174,This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7175,The requirements of the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7176,"From information in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements (STWDSR) (Ref. 5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation (WIST) (Ref. 6), and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref. 7) documents, it is possible to separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user’s interface or interaction with Clarus data.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7177,The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from raw field observations to various levels of data use.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7178,This is illustrated in Figure 4.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7179,Figure 4 – Clarus User Layers and Time Horizon Relationships,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7180,"The Autonomous Layer is comprised of operational entities who utilize weather and transportation data to make plans, decisions, and/or take action based upon sensor data within their control. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7181,"These data include observations collected by ESS, mobile data acquisition platforms, cameras, and other transportation-related measurement devices. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7182,The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of the raw input data to the Clarus system.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7183,The Clarus Layer lies between the Autonomous and Service Providers Layers and represents the nationwide system and architecture to accomplish the previously outlined goals of surface transportation environmental data collection and management.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7184,The Service Providers Layer is composed of both public and private entities that provide basic and value-added weather support services to support the weather information needs of the broader surface transportation community. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7185,"These support services rely on Clarus data (raw and processed) combined with other environmental, road condition, or traffic information products to develop or provide road weather information and enhanced products.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7186,The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a direct user of Clarus data. T,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7187,"he members of this group could be anyone using weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation community. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7188,"The weather products received by these end users are built from a combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data. In some instances, the Service Provider Customer Layer includes entities and agencies also found within the Autonomous Layer who receive quality control information on the data they originally provided to Clarus.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7189,Figure 4 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the stakeholder groups. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7190,"There is an inherent time scale, similar to Figure 3, emanating from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of data through the Clarus system and between the layers.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7191,The context diagram in Figure 5 illustrates the relationship of the entities interfacing with Clarus. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req

7203,This group places considerable emphasis on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level to make immediate decisions. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7204,"These users, primarily maintenance and operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided by surface transportation weather service providers. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7205,"Additional data from this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing and chemical application.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7206,Transit – These are the owners and operators of transit systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7207,This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7208,Rail – These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data from it. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7209,"This group places considerable emphasis on understanding weather conditions along designated routes plus weather-induced specifics such as rail temperatures, frozen switches, and drifting snow.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7210,Vehicle – Emerging technologies are developing that will encourage a greater level of data collection from vehicles for the purpose of understanding the nature of the transportation system state including the impacts of weather. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7211,"As this method of data collection matures, the information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7212,Surface Transportation Weather Service Providers (STWSP) – These surface transportation weather service providers are the private and public weather service providers who assimilate the Clarus data with other available data to generate value-added products and services used by the surface transportation decision-makers at state and local transportation agencies.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7213,Weather Service Providers – These include the weather support services that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic components of the Clarus data. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7214,"This group includes the efforts in public forecasting by NOAA and the National Weather Service (NWS) along with private sector weather services and their value-added support to markets such as agriculture, power utilities, and construction.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7215,"Research – This category incorporates federal, academic, and private sector researchers who are working to improve the state of knowledge and practice through the research of surface transportation weather.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7216,Archives – This category includes operational and non-operational interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7217,"The archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted to such efforts.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7218,Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on the design.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7219,Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system architecture and implementation.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7220,"To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and at potentially high rates. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7221,An architecture that spreads its data collection and dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may address this issue. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7222,The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the system to expand and add new data sources and end-users.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7223,Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment considerations. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7224,"Hardware, operating system, and development environment have significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7225,"To maximize system uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of the system. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7226,The primary challenge here will be the trade-off between the desire for reliability and the cost of redundancies.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7227,"While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7228,"Since Clarus is not replacing any existing application, the system is not currently critical to any operation or transportation function; neither is it intended to support any “critical national security missions”.",clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7229,"The system shall be “open,” using an architecture and communications interfaces that are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology industry. ",clarus high.doc,Not_Req

7231,Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent transportation system (ITS) standards.,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
7232,The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers. ,clarus high.doc,Not_Req
