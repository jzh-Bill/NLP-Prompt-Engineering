7458,It is intended primarily as a working document for NLM staff and defines the range of subjects to be acquired and the extent of the Library's collecting effort within these subjects. ,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7459,It also addresses selection issues presented by a range of formats and literature types.,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7460,The CDM is based on the Collection Development Policy adopted by the NLM Board of Regents in 1976 and amended in 1983 and 1992. ,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7461,The NLM Board of Regents policy statement that “the National Library of Medicine has the responsibility for acquiring the biomedical literature in any format deemed appropriate to the fulfillment of its mission” provides the underpinning for following the CDM policies for selection of materials for the NLM Digital Repository (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/).,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7462,National Library of Medicine Selection Criteria for Digital Reformatting,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7463,The National Library of Medicine Selection Criteria for Digital Reformatting (http://nlm.nih.gov/psd/pcm/digitizationcriteria.pdf) sets the priorities for the selection of materials from NLM’s collection to be digitized both for access and for preservation. ,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7464,"The goals of NLM’s digitization program are to increase access to its collections and provide wider use of its rich resources in the areas of medicine, health care and public health while preserving rare, valuable and fragile materials.",nlm.doc,Not_Req
7465,"Selection of materials for digital reformatting is based on monetary, scholarly and historical value; bibliographic control; frequency of use; physical condition; the existence of digital copies elsewhere; copyright status; and the appropriateness of digital reproductions for use and access.",nlm.doc,Not_Req
7466,"Because selection criteria for access are often different from those for preservation, the Library has created a different set of selection criteria for each mission. ",nlm.doc,Not_Req
7467,"Each approach focuses on all types of materials in the Library’s collections including but not limited to printed monographs and journals, manuscripts and archives, prints and photographs, and audiovisuals.",nlm.doc,Not_Req
7468,Permanence levels assigned to objects in the NLM Digital Repository should be based on the rating system developed by NLM to indicate to users which of its Web documents will be kept permanently available and whether the contents and identifiers of those documents could change over time. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/psd/pcm/devpermanence.html,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7469,The Library will follow the HHS/NIH/OCCS security policies for the NLM Digital Repository.,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7470,"The NLM Digital Repository will require more expansive, robust DTD encoding for textual materials than is currently available with the NLM Book and Historical Book DTDs. ",nlm.doc,Not_Req
7471,The group recommends the use of the TEI DTD in addition to the NLM Book and NLM Historical Book DTDs for encoding certain text materials. A more detailed justification is included in the report accompanying these requirements.,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7472,The NLM Metadata scheme should be reviewed to see if it meets current needs. ,nlm.doc,Not_Req

7475,A key area identified that will need policy development is migration strategies and methodologies. ,nlm.doc,Not_Req
7476,"Digital preservation is a combination of storing objects in formats that can be migrated, recording appropriate metadata to be able to manage the objects, ongoing monitoring for bit and media degradation and technology obsolescence, and migrating the files to newer hardware and software environments as needed to ensure their continued availability. ",nlm.doc,Not_Req
7477,"The preservation planning section of the functional requirements outlines the policy areas that need to be developed including monitoring changes in technology, evaluating the content in the archive, participating in standards development and developing migration plans, including goals, methods and schedules.
